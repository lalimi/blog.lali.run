Summary

### Platform Concept & Current Status

- A platform for selling digital educational products is being developed, with local Ukrainian focus initially
- The platform has generated interest from potential creators who are waiting for launch
- Currently in development stage, with plans to launch through Mono payment system
- Creator would focus on creating and selling digital products (courses, files, links)
- Platform serves primarily as a sales platform rather than a full LMS (Learning Management System)

### Business Model Concerns

- Concerns about financial sustainability with a low-price model
- Question of whether the platform can be profitable without requiring an unrealistic number of creators
- Need for a detailed financial model to demonstrate business viability
- Discussion of subscription-based model vs. commission-based model
- Under subscription model, creators would pay a fee to use the platform rather than a percentage of sales

### Payment Processing Challenges

- International platforms like Etsy and Gumroad use PayPal and Stripe, which aren't fully supported in Ukraine
- Currently planning to integrate with Mono for payment processing
- Mono offers payment splitting but only for Mono FOPs (private entrepreneurs)
- Waiting for Mono to provide integration tools
- Alternative payment processors discussed: LeekPay and Way4Pay
- Suggestion to establish an Estonian business entity through e-residency to access Stripe

### Creator Acquisition Challenges

- The biggest challenge identified is attracting and onboarding creators
- Many potential creators express interest but hesitate when it's time to create content
- Platform plans to provide resources on how to create courses, record content, set up equipment
- The zero-risk entry (no upfront payment from creators) is viewed as a major advantage

### Grant Funding Discussion

- Considered applying for Ukrainian grants but found them insufficient (250,000 UAH)
- Advisor suggests looking at non-Ukrainian grants (mentioned success with 420,000 EUR)
- Foreign grant organizations like USAID and EBRD were mentioned as options
- Potential advantage for women entrepreneurs applying for grants

### Advice on Financial Planning

- Need to develop a robust financial model with fixed and flexible costs
- Should include 12-month financial forecast and validation of sales funnel
- Important to consider risk mitigation in financial planning
- Advisor shared they've had 100% success rate getting funding with properly prepared financial models

### Action Items

- [ ]  Develop a more detailed financial model for the platform
- [ ]  Consider and evaluate subscription-based model as an alternative to commission-based
- [ ]  Continue pursuing integration with Mono for payment processing
- [ ]  Look into non-Ukrainian grants rather than Ukrainian ones
- [ ]  Launch demo version as planned before expanding functionality
- [ ]  Develop resources to help creators publish content more easily

Notes

Transcript

What can I do for you? I asked the same question. What can I do for you? I don't have a direct request. The platform is being created now, but there is no experience in creating such products. Previously, I was not involved in this area. In the last six months, I started to work on myself. I came up with this idea.

I saw that it is necessary, that it makes sense to be a response from the audience. I see some girls who constantly say, well, when is the launch? We are already waiting. So, you know, there are some operational moments, maybe some moments as a founder. I don't know.

I was interested in what you wrote about the fact that you have already created something like this and have not seen it Yes, yes. Yes, I am very worried here. If this is not an autonomous system, and it is most likely not autonomous, then we will need an administrator.

Some edits are based on feedback. So there is a cost factor, just in any way. And if there is such a cost factor, then the film model is very interesting. You tell me in the memo that the price is very low, and I am very worried about this. In order to make 10k on this project, it is necessary to sell a billion courses.

This is what is called stability. Because the first thing I thought was, okay, the idea is very cool, it does not have a top 3 in Ukraine, but there is a way of evaluating the market, whether it is worth it or not. And the simplest of all the theories that exist, the simplest one that we use, for example,

It's already cool. For example, I thought, OK, I can get money for this investment. For example, it doesn't matter where it comes from, whether it's a barter investment, like I usually do, or whether it's real money, whether it's German funds, Polish, Estonian.

There are very few Ukrainian ones, it's not interesting. And you can get it, but everyone will ask, OK, where is the durability of the model? And this durability of the model is shown in the finmodel. In order for the model to be stable, I need to add 20 creators every month, with at least 2 courses for each.

But if it turns out that the figure is not 20, but 1000, just to cover some expenses, then any officer will say, well, no, and so will a private investor. Therefore, the first question here is the model of sustainability. Because I am a creative conceptualist and everything is cool.

But it is very difficult without a film model.

Yes, I would give a grant for my own business to Ukrainian program, but they are more into physical business. They give money for canteens, sewing shops and so on. Online business is not so advanced. This experience has given me a business model of how much I need, how to get involved, how to advertise.

I was surprised by the good numbers. I see that it is abroad, but we don't have a local history. There is a need to... For example, Etsy, Gumroad, they only have Paypal and Stripe. In Ukraine, there is no such thing, it is not supported to transfer money through three knees. When I started to lead the trade, I already had some expertise, and I wanted to move through such platforms.

I even sold it. I had sales. I did it in two languages, in Ukrainian and in English. There were some sales, but it was impossible to withdraw money, because Paypal does not support in Ukraine. It's good that I didn't earn a lot, it's not a shame for the money. I think we should create something like this in Ukraine. I started to create these bots, but it's hard. I just realized that there are so many people like me.

Maybe someone has already started, maybe someone has already started. I talked to a girl who already has a lending, but she has a lending through Way4Pay. She said that she would sell the bonds through our platform. And she also needs a tool so that she can sell.

Oh, like this? Yes, yes. It's American. That's why she needs such an instrument. And the girl is normal. I see her in the recommendations all the time. She sells very well. So there is some feedback in this case. Where are you physically located? In Khmelnitsky. In Khmelnitsky. Ok. Almost a hometown.

I have worked closely with your company, even with Vlad. Ok, next question. You are a foreigner, which means you can theoretically open a sub-stripe. Even if you are in Estonia through e-residency, you can theoretically open a sub-stripe. I'm just a conceptualist, that's what I think, that's what I say. I'm just thinking out loud. If we want to sell abroad, and there is a real stopper for payment, then maybe it's easier to get a legal person somewhere in Estonia, to open a bank account.

This is done in four days. And then have a stripe. What will you get? If you even come up with... Well, maybe you've already come up with it, and you'll tell me now, but I'll first finish what I've thought of. If you make a stripe there and a legal person there, then you have the possibility of self-distribution of money. What does it mean? For example, if it comes to the account for the course of some Alyona,

80% went to Alyona, 5% went to taxes. 15% went to you, for example. There is this auto-division. As far as I know in Ukraine, maybe you have already come up with something, there is no such auto-division. That is, all the money received will be paid by you.

How cool is that? We are now working through Mono. We are planning to launch through Mono. They have this distribution, payment splitting. The only thing is that they do it only with Mono FOPs. If Alena comes and she has a FOB of mono, it is automatically divided. But I have been waiting for a month for answers. We have submitted the application, we have already talked to tech specialists from mono, but they have not yet given us an instrument to integrate it.

Now it is just an aquarium, which is available, but there is no distribution yet. There are some others, like LeekPay, Way4Pay. They may also have this distribution. I don't know. If it is Way4Pay, then it should be distributed to any bank. But even if it's Ukrainian, it won't be recorded. Anyway, the Frenchman will have to pay. Or, as you say, they won't be able to pay at all.

At the beginning I planned a local story, to go out and look at the world There are giants in this story, and it will be hard to reach them. At the beginning I wanted something local, but now it's a war. Many people need local history, Ukrainian history, and we will support it.

What else did I think about? If there is still a percentage, who wants to sell, but it is not registered as a FOB? Some people wrote that the commission would be too high, like 30%. But most people said that it would be OK if you wrote that it was a tax.

20% and it will be very good if we get paid for it. It can become a violation of the law for those who want to squeeze Fedorov and so on. The same platform, the same accounts. That is, a person can register as a teacher and as a student. The same lessons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then testing, automated, trolley.

But when it came to money, we had two options. Either we go to the international, like Visa, we go to the history of Stripe, and then we have to... He pays subscription fees. He doesn't pay a percentage of sales. That's his model. But he pays subscription because he exists and teaches as many courses as he needs, depending on the tariff.

We have been working on it for 4 or 5 days. Maybe you should look at it from a different perspective. Maybe this model will suit you. So he takes money from somewhere and gets an e-mail saying that he can add it. So it's just a subscription to the authors and that's it. Yes.

Interesting story. We are looking for books, guides, notions. Templates. Yes, not only for the course, but also for future features, paid subscriptions, calls, coffee for the creator, etc. I don't know. Now I work as an IT specialist, and I work for free, because I don't have any money yet.

He said that he understands everything, because he launched his own products. He understands that we will talk about the money when they are in the project. It is difficult for me, but I will do my best. At first, I thought I could handle it myself, as a tech-specialist, but now I understand that it would be better for me to hire someone for a percentage of the project.

The best story. I have a production, a house, a clothing brand. The best story is just to take someone who is handsome in his own way. It's more motivation, faster. I understand, but the meaning is the same. But you still have to think about stability. Maybe you also need to take such a model as I tell you about the film model. Because it will be easier for you to calculate the film model. Much easier.

But you know, I thought about it now, but then what is the sense in our platform, just to make it a place, as I understand it, for the EMS, for the Educational... LMS. Yes, LMS. We don't implement LMS in this way. We have it more as a platform for sale.

Digital products. I understand it perfectly. Yes, and that's why the essence of this platform is disappearing. No, no, no, it's not disappearing. If you make such a story about a film model, well, again, you will do it anyway. I'm just saying about this story, how we do it.

What does it mean? It doesn't matter what digital product you sell. It can be a course, it can be a link to a file, it can be access to a link or something else. It's just that the creator gets the money in a different way. That's the point. He gets his money somehow. He made a button for himself on Monopay. Or he made something else. It doesn't matter.

The student automatically receives an email saying that he has paid for this and that, and now a new student has been added to his account. Or, for example, a person who can load something has been added. It's easier to calculate. It's more robust. And you won't have any issues with taxes, with the tax system, with the budget.

I don't know, as an option. I'm just... Oh, by the way, since we're just talking like this, the problem doesn't really arise in the development, but in the flow of creators. That's the story. For example, we didn't have a technical question. As soon as we realized that we could approach the issue like this, we also wanted to start with a full all-inclusive payment. And then it turned out that this is an unstable story. But the biggest instability is the story with the creator.

Because, for example, there is 1% of creators who are ready to post something, files, it doesn't matter what. But there are those who are like, yes, yes, you tell them right away, that's it, we are open, post. And he starts a bunch of stoppers, like, oh, you have to write a course.

There are a lot of similar stories. And this is a much more important problem than to include proper punctuation. I thought about it at once. There are several experts in their fields. How to create your own products? How to increase your knowledge? We have the same topic in Roadmap. How to add courses, how to change courses, how to record courses, which microphone, how to clean the sound, how to set the light.

Yes, we have such a system. It is a relief, yes, but it is not resolved. We found these guys who sell courses for $399. Let's ask them. We'll have a platform. He says, I'll pay in cash. We tell him, it's not a question, you can record how you spent that group Zoom and sell it, it's already your product. And I didn't record it.

I will think about it. We have requests for three months and he thinks about everything. This can turn out to be a much bigger problem than the technical side. I looked at this story from the side, if not a subscription, which is easier for them. I mean, I don't take money from them in advance. What if they don't buy? What if they burn out? As I tell them, your task is only to create a description, to create the product itself.

And that's it. Launch it and sell it. And then, when you sell it, we will take our commission from it. That's it. You know, it doesn't bind anything, it doesn't oblige. This is a super advantage. Super advantage. Now the only question is the durability. It was an awesome advantage. Our product and your product, your product will have this advantage.

It is 100% because you enter almost without a risk or without a risk. This is very cool. But financial stability can then come out sideways. I don't know. I thought it was some kind of an expert who would calculate everything for me. I calculated everything myself. I have almost everything there.

I don't know.

I just didn't see your film model. If you have everything calculated, you can show it. I have 24 minutes left. Well, I can't find it right now. I need to get the documents for this grant. In short, there should be fixes and flexes at the start of the month, and then a 12-month financial forecast. If it works, then a funnel is added from above and it is calculated whether it is possible at all to get this amount of profits.

We recently had a conversation with an entrepreneur from Khmelnytskyi. I don't know if you saw it, but I made a video about $10,000. You didn't see it, did you? No, I probably didn't. Well, how to put any owner in a deadlock. You tell him, under what conditions are you ready to pay your seller $10,000.

This is the first stopper. He never thought about it. And even if he doesn't have a stopper, for example, he sells a car or an apartment, and he doesn't have a stopper, he can say, sell me 10 apartments and I'll give you 10,000 dollars. Then the next question arises.

Okay, under what conditions can you pay $10,000 so that the production doesn't go down? It doesn't matter what. Service or goods. So in these film models, it is very important, in addition to the fact that the economy itself or the funnel itself coincides.

Like, how much traffic should there be of interested e-converters so that you can serve them. If nothing goes wrong, that's great. If something goes wrong, you close the risks of the finmodel. For example, more servers, if we're talking about IT. Thank you.

Thank you for sharing your time with us. Finmodel will have to go into more detail, but we have already planned a demo version, and then we will expand functionality Try it, try it. Maybe we don't know something. You know, you can have a lot of experience, and then reality changes everything. Well, yes, as it is said in a movie or somewhere, that a student overslept the whole lecture and at the end saw the problem and did not know that this equation is impossible to solve, and he solved it.

I just didn't know that it wouldn't be edited. There is a movie called Will Hunting. Yes, it's from the summer, right? Yes, yes. He used to be a janitor. What else can I say? It's a very interesting story. I really want to do something like this. We will try to get grants. I, as a woman, have a lot of advantages for entrepreneurs.

We are waiting, we will work. Maybe something will come out of it. Maybe. But I don't advise you to look at Ukrainian grants. What you said about 250,000 UAH is just a shame. For example, 250,000 rubles, what is the main condition? You give it to two employees. And 250,000 rubles divided by 12 months and divided by two employees is already a problem.

That's the story. I just tried it. I thought it would work out. I tried, but... It's better to do something else. It's better to do something else. We closed the place for 420,000 euros. Both grants were non-Ukrainian. That is, a person has only an idea, and here are my photos, and that's it. Everything else, we came up with, made a film model, thank God. But this would not be possible with Ukrainian grants.

So, you hire a start-up company and work with them, developing their story? Yes. We developed in such a way that the idea was that if you produce yourself, what I'm looking at is a knife, or you buy them in China and sell them in Ukraine. You come to CitiProfit, and CitiProfit says, we made it in your place like this. Just like I just told you, we made it like this.

If you like it more or less, well, we usually say that 80% of you like it, it means that you can work. If you like it and your eyes are burning, well, that's it. It requires a lot of trust from the client, of course, but this is our main profile. And business plans, start-up models...

It used to be free. We just did it, because you can't work without it. But then it turned out that it was a very valuable thing. We didn't know it was a very valuable thing. And we started selling it as a separate service. When it comes to grants, there are organizations like USAID and EBRR, which provide support in Ukraine. They checked us and called each of our clients.

We still have 99% of what we submitted. I say 99% because maybe I don't know something. I can say 100%. 100% of what we submitted, like pitch decks, finotelli, start-up models, business plans, we received all the investments. Without exception. We don't have...

And then we had to wait for the next grant. No, we didn't have that. We wrote and submitted. I was one of those people who don't believe in grants at all. Like, they can just give money to someone for no reason. I graduated from the second high school in Lodz. And when I figured out this story, I realized that a lot depends on the partners.

When you submit a business plan or a startup model, you write that you have such and such partners, contractors, and so on, such and such co-founders. If there is a co-founder of CitiProfit, which has already checked 200 plus projects, and they are not checked on business plans, they are checked, including how everything was integrated into real life.

We would build a sale, a clean profit for the owner, and so on. It's just that we are partners, and the plus to karma is always automatic. We don't need to prove a lot of things, unlike others who apply. It turns out that even if there is one protest in the competition, well, if it was ever submitted, then you know, there are applications. If they come, they come to the same program, there are 50 of them.

And you need to choose three. Knowing how it is presented in Ukraine, I wrote to you on a piece of paper, I will tell you, I have a presentation, and here I have a fish wrapped in it, and we have an awesome presentation with all the confirmed data. And okay, a lot of pluses to karma, you come to the finals, in general, easily.

That's it. So, yeah. That's how we work. Under what conditions? You need to know where you're going. We don't do this stuff, it's not our profile. We have what we don't do. For example, SMM doesn't have paid advertising. We don't even have that in services.

We can't order ads on Facebook, right? And likewise, according to the business plan, we can't order a search for a grantee. You have to look for it yourself. For example, oh, I found that in Giz. I can only say where to look. Theoretically, where would I look?

We are not looking for anything for you. Have you found, for example, in GISS that there is an open program, it is valid until March 2026, you can submit applications. Oh, cool. We looked at the conditions, you showed, well, you already found, downloaded these conditions, showed what kind of film model they are looking for in this format.

Well, usually it's EFRS. Well, like, here's the EFRS format, and here's the first stage, second stage, third. We're like, okay. We will ask you about the product, how it will be sold, if there are pre-orders, etc. I can show you an example, but let's do it next time.

We have already done everything for you, you just checked that we are selling red, but in fact blue. You just checked that. And so we have already done everything as if we had done it. Almost all the services we sell are in the format of how we would do it. You say, only references, this is what I like, this is what I like.

I don't know, it depends on your personality. And that's it. And then we did everything ourselves. You just have to go and defend yourself. I see. It's an interesting story. Maybe we'll talk about it in the future. Yes, yes. Thank you. Well, I'll take a couple of insights from Dmitry.

Let's put it this way. We don't have any obligations. I just met with you and told you. Thank you very much for your experience and for agreeing to talk. Everything is cool. Come to visit us when you need to ask something. We are very open. I am very open. We have a lot of social networks. We have social projects. We help the villages and schools. If you are interested, come and talk.

Very nice. Thank you very much. Ok. Ok. See you. See you.
